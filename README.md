# Portfolio

This repository contains my portfolio website (Project 3 of the FEND nanodegree program). In this project, I employed HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create a responsive website to showcase my FEND projects.

In addition to the basic functionality, I employed modals to provide a more detailed description of each project. To see the modal, click on the project image.

This portfolio website may be viewed on my GitHub page [here](https://chspanos.github.io/portfolio).
