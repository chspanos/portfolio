# Portfolio

This repository contains my portfolio website (Project 3 of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer nanodegree program). In this project, I employed HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create a responsive website to showcase my FEND projects.

In addition to the basic functionality, I employed ```Bootstrap modals``` to provide a more detailed description of each project. To see the modals, click on each project image.

My portfolio website may be viewed on my GitHub page [here](https://chspanos.github.io/portfolio).

## Project Details

In this project, we were given a mockup design of the portfolio and asked to replicate it using HTML5 and CSS.

The mockup portfolio had the following major components:
* A Header section containing a logo, name, and role
* A hero image section
* A _Featured Work_ section, containing subsections with images for each featured project

We employed a grid-based layout, using either ```flexbox``` or a framework like ```Bootstrap``` to layout the page.

All portfolio content had to be responsive, so that it would display properly on various devices, including:
* Desktop
* Mobile: Google Nexus 5
* Tablet: Apple iPad

Frameworks and/or media-queries were employed to make all images responsive. In addition, I used ```srcset``` in the image elements to provide optimized images for different device sizes.

The final portfolio also had to be customized using HTML and/or CSS to customize images, text, placement, or style.
